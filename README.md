# Movie Fight
A game that compares different movies, the movie with the biggest numbers wins!

A user can search for a movie which is then shown on one side of the screen, a second movie is then searched for on the second side of the screen which is also shown. Those two movies are then compared, the movie with the biggest score wins.
